  "readme": "#Sparkle Turntable Bot\n\nA customizable Turntable.fm bot written in node.js utilizing [ttapi](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API).\n\nThis project is still maintained, but I don't have a lot of time for development (so updates will probably be slow). If you have new features or bugfixes, please submit a pull request.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install sparklebot\n\nCheck out the [Get Started guide](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot/wiki/Get-Started) over on the project's [Wiki page](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot/wiki) for detailed installation instructions.\n\n## News\n3/16/13 - I'm currently working on updating the bot to use sqlite instead of MySQL. What this means is it will no longer be necessary to set up a database for the bot (it's entirely contained within and managed by Sparkle). This should hopefully make installation much easier. There's no ETA for when this will be done, but if you want to try it out, a (somewhat) working copy is available on the dev branch.\n\n## Features\n\nThis bot is written in Node.JS and utilizes Alain Gilbert's Turntable API.\n\nThe bot can: \n\n* Respond to a set of commands in chat and through turntable's PM system\n* Awesome songs based on various systems\n* Log vote, chat, song, and room events in the console\n* Report song stats in chat after each song\n* Welcome users to the room via chat and PM\n* Enforce room rules regarding song limits and timeouts before a person can DJ again\n* Log song statistics and chat entries in a MySQL database\n* Receive and respond to commands via a HTTP RESTful API\n* Manage a waitlist/queue for a room\n",
